# Obsidian Tag Studio Plugin

This plugin allows users to query for files within the vault based on the TagStudio tagging system. However, this plugin only allows a user to SQL query on the TagStudio SQLite database. This means users cannot query using the TagStudio query language to search, as its meant to be a quick and dirty solution to incorporate a tagged library of photos to obsidian for quick lookups and group image additions.

# Updates and Future

I do not have the intention of keeping this plugin up to date with newer versions of Obsidian or TagStudio, and new features and fixes are unlikely to be implemented. When the TagStudio API is finished, the project may get revisited, but likely under a new repo that will be linked from here.
