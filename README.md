# Obsidian Tag Studio Plugin

# âš  Warning!

This plugin does not work standalone, and requires a modified version of Tag Studio to function. If the modified version gets uploaded to github, then I will link it. Otherwise this repo is mostly here to demonstrate the what a primitive version of a plugin for Tag Studio would behave like. When the TagStudio API is released, this plugin may get revisited. 

# The Plugin

As this plugin was made for myself to organize notes for a game, the plugin currently only allows for a user to query a TagStudio library using the name of a group node in a canvas. No previews, no confirmations, and the contents of the group will be deleted on run.  

# Updates and Future

I do not have the intention of keeping this plugin up to date with newer versions of Obsidian or TagStudio, and new features and fixes may not be implemented.
